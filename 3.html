<h2>javascript</h2>
<p>
   javascript is program code that doesn’t need pre-processing (e.g. compiling) before being run. In the context of a Web browser, scripting usually refers to program code written in JavaScript that is executed by the browser when a page is downloaded, or in response to an event triggered by the user.</p>
<p>
  This additional interactivity makes Web pages behave like a traditional software application.</p>These Web pages are often called Web applications and can be made available either directly in the browser as a Web page, or can be packaged and distributed as Widgets.
